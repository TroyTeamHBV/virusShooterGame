Virus Shooter Game

This is the first game we are making for Troy High School's TeamHBV. 
The game will start off using the code from this great site http://www.kilobolt.com/game-development-tutorial.html.
We plan to add on to the game upon completion of the tutorial.

Note:
The files in this repo are up to Unit 2 Day 4 Lesson #2-10 of the tutorial.
The virus image is made but the virus shooter isn't yet so anything that requires the robot image will have to use a placeholder until I am able to make an image.
